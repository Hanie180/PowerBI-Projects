# üåè Migration & Demographics Dashboard (Australia 1996‚Äì2016)

## 1. Overview

This report aims to analyze **Australia's demographic shifts from 1996 to 2016**, with a particular emphasis on understanding the evolving characteristics of migrant populations. Leveraging the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) dataset, this analysis examines ten key countries of birth (COBs) spanning five continents. A storytelling dashboard approach is employed to reveal demographic trends, including patterns of **population growth, shifts in age structures, geographic settlement preferences, and gender distributions**. By uncovering these dynamics, the report helps inform targeted policy-making and effective resource allocation strategies across Australia's diverse migrant communities.

## 2. Background Context
Migration has been a defining feature of Australia‚Äôs demographic evolution, **reshaping the nation‚Äôs cultural diversity, labour markets and service-delivery needs**. Since the post-war period, waves of migrants from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas have contributed to both population growth and diversification. Over time, shifts in global geopolitics, economic opportunities and immigration policy have altered the composition and geographic distribution of these migrant flows. For this analysis, we **focus on ten country-of-birth (COBs) grouped by continent: Europe (England, Switzerland), Asia (China, Vietnam), Africa (Egypt, South Africa), Americas (USA, Brazil), Oceania (Australia, New Zealand)**. This grouping allows us to compare long-standing European communities with rapidly expanding Asian cohorts, while also examining smaller but strategically important migrant streams from Africa, the Americas and neighbouring Oceania. By tracking population totals, age-group proportions and state-level distribution over the 20-year period (1996 - 2016), we aim to **explore the differences in population growth, age structures and settlement preferences that make up Australia‚Äôs migrant landscape**.

## 3. Key Questions
1. How has Australia‚Äôs population grown and changed across states?  
2. What demographic patterns emerge in terms of **age and gender**?  
3. How have migrant populations evolved by **continent and country of birth**?  
4. Which states are most attractive to different migrant groups, and how has this changed over time?  
5. Are migrant populations aging faster than Australian-born residents?

## üìä Dashboards

### **Dashboard 1 ‚Äì Australia‚Äôs Population Overview**
- Growth from **14.7M (1996) to 20M (2016)** (+36%)  
- NSW, Victoria, and Queensland remain dominant in population share  
- Working-age group (25‚Äì64) consistently strongest, but retiree segment (65+) growing steadily  
- Gender balance remains stable across states  

### **Dashboard 2 ‚Äì Migrant Population by Continent & Country of Birth**
- Shift from **European-dominated migration** to **Asian-led growth** (China, Vietnam, India rising sharply)  
- European cohorts show significant aging; Asian, African, and American cohorts remain predominantly young & working-age  
- NSW and Victoria attract the largest share, with growing settlement in WA and Queensland  
- Gender balance largely equal; slight female majority among Asian migrants  

### **Dashboard 3 ‚Äì In-depth Migrant Patterns**
- Migrants aging faster than Australian-born (e.g., 30% of England- & Egypt-born aged 65+ vs 13% of natives in 2016)  
- Brazil and China show rapid, sustained growth, reshaping migrant demographics  
- Insights highlight pressure points for **aged care, language services, and education policies**

## üß† Policy Insights
- **Aging European migrants** ‚Üí urgent need for tailored aged-care and health services  
- **Youth-heavy Asian, African, and American migrants** ‚Üí demand for education, language support, and job placement  
- **Decentralization of migrant settlement** ‚Üí services must expand beyond NSW and Victoria into WA, QLD, SA
